// What is the difference between var and let?

//var is old, let is post 2015
//var you can redeclair, let you cannot.  var is function scope, let is block scope






//What is the difference between var and const?
//const is post 2015
//const you cannot reassign, or redeclair.  const is block scope


//What is the difference between let and const?
//  you cannot reassign const like you can let



//What is hoisting? - the declarations are run before the rest of the code;  let and cost do not have hoisting, 
//the declarations are run in the order from everything else.  
//Also cannot declare a variable with const and have it be undefined like you can with var;
